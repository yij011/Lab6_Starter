In a medium bowl, whisk&nbsp;together melted butter, brown&nbsp;sugar, and molasses until dissolved. Make a well in the flour mixture&nbsp;and pour in melted butter mixture.&nbsp;Stir with a rubber spatula until no&nbsp;dry patches remain. (Add a little&nbsp;water, up to 1 tablespoon, to bring&nbsp;dough together if necessary.) Turn out dough onto a clean&nbsp;work surface and knead gently to&nbsp;form a ball. Divide the dough in half&nbsp;and form each into a 1\" thick disk&nbsp;then wrap in plastic. Refrigerate&nbsp;until firm, at least 4 hours, or up&nbsp;to 2 days. Repeat steps to make a&nbsp;second batch of dough. Preheat oven to 375\u00ba with a&nbsp;rack in the center position. Line&nbsp;three rimmed baking sheets with&nbsp;parchment paper. Print and cut out the gingerbread&nbsp;house templates. Working with one disk at a time,&nbsp;roll dough on a lightly floured work&nbsp;surface to 1\u20444\" thick. Use a pizza&nbsp;wheel or sharp knife to cut around&nbsp;the gingerbread house templates,&nbsp;cutting two of each shape. (Gather&nbsp;and refrigerate scraps while you're working with remaining dough;&nbsp;they can be rerolled once.) Transfer&nbsp;gingerbread cutouts to baking&nbsp;sheets, leaving 1\" of space around&nbsp;each, and freeze until firm, 15&nbsp;minutes. Bake gingerbread cookies one&nbsp;tray at a time, until puffed and&nbsp;firm, about 28 minutes. Let cool&nbsp;on baking sheets 5 minutes, then&nbsp;transfer to wire racks to cool&nbsp;completely. Assemble house with&nbsp;Royal Icing and decorate.<br> In a large bowl using a hand mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, beat egg whites and salt on medium speed until frothy. Add 1\u20442 cup powdered sugar and continue mixing on low speed until sugar is moistened. Increase to medium speed and beat 20 seconds.&nbsp;Continue adding powdered sugar&nbsp;in batches until the mixture forms a&nbsp;thick paste. (If using a hand mixer,&nbsp;use a rubber spatula once mixture&nbsp;is thick.)<br> Stir in vinegar a little at a time,&nbsp;mixing well, until icing resembles&nbsp;the consistency of toothpaste.&nbsp;Adjust texture by adding vinegar or&nbsp;powdered sugar as needed.<br>      Transfer about 1\u00bd cups royal icing to a piping bag fitted with a coupler and a \u00bc\" round tip. Keep remaining icing in bowl, covered with plastic pressed directly on the surface to prevent it from drying out. Pipe a generous bead of frosting on the bottom and one vertical edge of one side of the gingerbread house and position on a serving platter or board. Hold the piece upright, while you pipe a bead of frosting along the bottom edge of a perpendicular side of the house. Affix the second side of the house to the board forming a corner with the first piece. Insert T-pins through the corner to stabilize while the icing dries or place sturdy glasses or cans around the gingerbread pieces to balance. Pipe a generous bead of icing on the inside corner and bottom edge of both pieces.&nbsp; Repeat with the remaining two sides of the house. Let stand undisturbed in a cool, dry place until the icing sets, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Pipe a generous bead of frosting along the roofline of the house. Affix the roof pieces, using T-pins or tall glasses to hold them in place while the icing dries, at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove when the icing has dried.","video":[],"recipeCuisine":["American"],"recipeCategory":["vegetarian","Christmas","dessert"],"recipeYield":"1","description":"Perfection isn\u2019t the name of the game here.
