But we think this reduced-sugar apple cider latte may just give the PSL a run for its money. Though to some it may seem a bit strange to mix cider and coffee, the tart sweetness of the apple really helps to bring out the subtle fruity notes of the espresso, especially if you've brewed a shot with some high-quality espresso. And it is all balanced with the toasty warm brown sugar-like sweetness of Truvia Sweet Complete brown.","duration":"PT1M16S","embedUrl":"https://glimmer.hearstapps.com/?id=92bf2071-f8a1-4deb-9331-51bd0b5d6a7d","name":"Apple Cider Latte","thumbnailUrl":"https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/f15fd4b4-7c42-4e37-bedb-5adc0694d148/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1634219466_25165.jpg","uploadDate":"2021-10-14T13:50:00.724388Z"},"recipeCuisine":[],"recipeCategory":["brunch","winter","beverages","breakfast","brunch"],"recipeYield":"1","description":"This fall coffee drink is totally easy to whip up and absolutely delicious.
